# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 28th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried out FreeCodeCamp.org, got bored and started dabbling with Python. Fiddling around with mean, median and mode functions that are part of the Python library. I'm doing so becaue I am currently taking statistics.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with remembering syntax of Python but nothing a little Google searching couldn't do.

### Day 2: June 29th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Currently reading "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python" to understand the Python language better. I am understanding the language but there are concepts I'm still trying to wrap my head around like nested for loops and being able to manipulate lists and tuples. The author includes coding exercises after each chapter so I attempt them but I end up not finding my answer in the book so I do some Google searching to see what others have done. It helps bring context to the exercises. It feels like I spoil the fun of figuring out the programs myself but there's no way I could come up with the code myself quite yet... yet.

**Thoughts**: Python is flexible and easy to read compared to most languages I have worked with. If I keep practicing (which is why I'm donig 100-days-of-code) I know I will become fluent in the language.

### Day 3: June 30th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I went on codeacademy.com to work on SQL. I find SQL interesting because it is database organization which peaks my interest. I completed the exercises and took the multiple choice quiz and received an 83% on the quiz which is okay. I learned how to manipulate searches by giving certain parameters to the search. Clauses such as: WHERE, LIKE, CASE, LIMIT, ORDER BY, etc are all used to narrow down searchs and to speed up search times. SQL is fun because I like manipulating data and seeing results. :)

**Thoughts**: Today, I did not want to read a whole chapter in my book then start to code, so I just went on codeacademy.com to quickly start coding. It is a helpful website and it makes learning new languages less daunting. Whenever I heard someone speak of SQL I was immediately intimidated but there is no reason to be. I am on this journey to learn and I can't let any mental blocks deter me from my goals. My goals are to have enough knowledge in computer programming to be employeable. I know I will be a great asset to a company someday.

### Day 4: July 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reading "How To Automate the Boring Stuff With Python". It's a great book. Today I read chapter 5 which is about dictionaries. The author had me code a tic-tac-toe game using dictionaries and it made perfect sense. The game board was a data structure and the computer knows how to interpret it because I gave it the parameters to do so. Then I coded an inventory list and printed how many total items in the inventory as well as the quantity of each item. Good day of coding so far.

**Thoughts**: I can feel myself becoming better already. It's only been four days but I've been having a fun time coding. There are still concepts I'm trying to wrap my head around like dictionaries and lists but I am a lot less perplexed with those ideas. Onward.

### Day 5: July 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Wow, I'm dabbling with data visualization and I'm having a blast. I read data from an excel sheet and started plotting points on a graph with ease. I'm using Jupyter Notebook for all my data visualization work and so far it's so fun for me. My favorite subreddit is r/dataisbeautiful. I can't wait to start conducting my own experiments and graphing the data.

**Thoughts:** Data Analysis intrigues me. I'm going to keep practicing with Jupyter Notebook and Python because it has been so user-friendly so far. My graphs will become more in depths and pretty and it just makes me gitty thinking about it all. It's only been 5 days and I'm going to be a data expert by the end of this journey! There are no links to projects today because I was just tinkering with the software.

### Day 6: July 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** This morning I played around with Seaborn. It is a Python library for making interesting looking graphs. Today I used ViolinPlot to graph heart pulse by the amount of time rest. I'm amazed on how quick and painless it is with Python to create very interesting looking graphs! I was getting stuck but I used Google and Youtube videos to figure it out (for the most part).

**Thoughts:** Python is such a powerful language. I like being able to record data and then plot points. I have always liked collecting data but now since I know how easy it is to graph data in cool new interesting ways, I literally want to record everything and graph it. More to come. No GitHub link to the project yet because I'm trying to figure out how to push Jupyter Notebook files to GitHub.

### Day 7: July 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** What a morning it was. I woke up around 8am and started coding around 8:30am and it is now 3:22pm and I have finially finished my little data visualization project. I went through each of 21 Savages Albums and recorded how many times he says the words, "Dick" and "Pussy" in his songs because it's like every time I hear a 21 Savage song, those words are the most reoccuring throughout! So I did a little experimenting and this is what I came up with.

**Thoughts:** It was a blast recording this data. I realize I could be recording more valueable data but why not do this for fun?! More data viz projects to come!

### Day 8: July 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Okay so I decided to mess around with more data visualization stuff. Today I struggle more. I'm trying to work with the actual Seaborn born library but my graphs still just look like standard matplotlib graphs. I want my graphs more elaborate and easy to look at. I'm understanding Jupyter Notebook a lot more and now all I want to do is graph data. I have a link to the project I worked on today.

**Thoughts:** I'm becoming more fluent in writing code. I'm starting to understand the syntax so much more just by analyzing other's work. And by analyzing other's work, I can manipulate my own code to work around the template of their work. It is great fun!
