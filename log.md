# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 15, 2019

**Today's Progress:**

I'm developing an application for long tail keyword research and I need to use the Googleads API. 

BUT I'm having trouble using the API. 

I spent the last hour researching, reading blog posts, and watching videos about the API but I can't find anything useful.

All of the documentation is there on Google yet I can't seem to grasp it.

I will work on it more tomorrow. 

I made progress in what I want the program to do. 

All I know is that the program will be the most efficient if I use the AdWords API.

**Thoughts:** 

I want this program to be efficient so that's why I need to use the API. I need to get this down.
