# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 15, 2019

**Today's Progress:**

I'm developing an application for long tail keyword research and I need to use the Googleads API. 

BUT I'm having trouble using the API. 

I spent the last hour researching, reading blog posts, and watching videos about the API but I can't find anything useful.

All of the documentation is there on Google yet I can't seem to grasp it.

I will work on it more tomorrow. 

I made progress in what I want the program to do. 

All I know is that the program will be the most efficient if I use the AdWords API.

**Thoughts:** 

I want this program to be efficient so that's why I need to use the API. I need to get this down.

### Day 2: July 16th, 2019

**Today's Progress:**

Today I coded for about 2 hours and I got a lot done.

I'm building the autocomplete scraper just like Keyword Researcher but I will make my software more user friendly.

I'm practically stealing Keyword Researcher's functionality. I want to make my own version so I won't have to pay for Keyword Researcher. 

It's legitimate Google data too which is very useful. I'm using Python and I need to be able to parse JSON data.

**Thoughts:**

This will take some time to complete but it's a lot of fun so far. I'm glad it's actual data that can be useful. :) 

I LOVE data scraping!

### Day 3: July 17th, 2019

**Today's Progress:**

I figured out how to make a function for the search query and append all the searches to a list.

Now I need to figure out how to take a multidimensional list and put it into one column using pandas.

Once I figure that out, it's basically game over.

I'm proud, I actually made a working function and used StackOverflow to figure it out. And it only took me an hour.

A lot of trial and error but it's chill.

I'm having fun with this knocking it out piece by piece.

### Day 4: July 18th, 2019

**Today's Progress:**

Getting better at wrangling data and making clean code.

I figured out how to make multiple columns into one column and all with very little code.

It's fun when everything works out. 

Now I need to figure out how to use the Google Adwords API so I can get search volume data back. That is the most important aspect.

I asked someone on Fiverr if they are able to do Google Adwords API setup. Hopefully it all works out.

Chipping away little by little. :)

### Day 5: July 19th, 2019

**Today's Progress:**

I checked my progress today and I was mad at myself. For the past couple days I have only been coding for a minimum of an hour. I need to change up my habit.

I pretty much finished my little program. I haven't gotten the chance to find out about search volume. But that's okay.

I'm trying to figure out what website I could make. I love making websites but I need a purpose. I could make that free keyword research tool and make it a web app. That would be super good for the resume. I think I'm going to try that! Buy a domain and make it super user friendly!

That would get me lots of traffic! So I need to learn how to deploy websites like ubersuggest and all of that stuff.

### Day 6: July 22nd, 2019

**Today's Progress:**

Tried installing Flask and Django but I am running into roadblocks. 

It will have to be for another day because I am sicker than swine right now. Head ache and such. 

But learning and trouble shooting is all I can ask for on this one.
