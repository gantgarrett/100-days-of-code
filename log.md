# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 15, 2019

**Today's Progress:**

I'm developing an application for long tail keyword research and I need to use the Googleads API. 

BUT I'm having trouble using the API. 

I spent the last hour researching, reading blog posts, and watching videos about the API but I can't find anything useful.

All of the documentation is there on Google yet I can't seem to grasp it.

I will work on it more tomorrow. 

I made progress in what I want the program to do. 

All I know is that the program will be the most efficient if I use the AdWords API.

**Thoughts:** 

I want this program to be efficient so that's why I need to use the API. I need to get this down.

### Day 2: July 16th, 2019

**Today's Progress:**

Today I coded for about 2 hours and I got a lot done.

I'm building the autocomplete scraper just like Keyword Researcher but I will make my software more user friendly.

I'm practically stealing Keyword Researcher's functionality. I want to make my own version so I won't have to pay for Keyword Researcher. 

It's legitimate Google data too which is very useful. I'm using Python and I need to be able to parse JSON data.

**Thoughts:**

This will take some time to complete but it's a lot of fun so far. I'm glad it's actual data that can be useful. :) 

I LOVE data scraping!

### Day 3: July 17th, 2019

**Today's Progress:**

I figured out how to make a function for the search query and append all the searches to a list.

Now I need to figure out how to take a multidimensional list and put it into one column using pandas.

Once I figure that out, it's basically game over.

I'm proud, I actually made a working function and used StackOverflow to figure it out. And it only took me an hour.

A lot of trial and error but it's chill.

I'm having fun with this knocking it out piece by piece.
