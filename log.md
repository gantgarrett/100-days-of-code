# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 28th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried out FreeCodeCamp.org, got bored and started dabbling with Python. Fiddling around with mean, median and mode functions that are part of the Python library. I'm doing so becaue I am currently taking statistics.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with remembering syntax of Python but nothing a little Google searching couldn't do.


### Day 2: June 29th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
