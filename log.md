# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 28th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried out FreeCodeCamp.org, got bored and started dabbling with Python. Fiddling around with mean, median and mode functions that are part of the Python library. I'm doing so becaue I am currently taking statistics.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with remembering syntax of Python but nothing a little Google searching couldn't do.


### Day 2: June 29th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Currently reading "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python" to understand the Python language better. I am understanding the language but there are concepts I'm still trying to wrap my head around like nested for loops and being able to manipulate lists and tuples. The author includes coding exercises after each chapter so I attempt them but I end up not finding my answer in the book so I do some Google searching to see what others have done. It helps bring context to the exercises. It feels like I spoil the fun of figuring out the programs myself but there's no way I could come up with the code myself quite yet... yet.

**Thoughts**: Python is flexible and easy to read compared to most languages I have worked with. If I keep practicing (which is why I'm donig 100-days-of-code) I know I will become fluent in the language.
